What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: you can control the version more precisely and it can be effective.
    cons: if you can't choose the right period, it could cause bad impacts.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because a program can be consist of several files and those files can be edited 
at one time. It helps programmers to keep track on the whole program.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    We can use git log to view the whole history and use git diff to see the difference
between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It will makes be not afraid of making mistakes because I can always go back to 
the correct version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To creat git repository to do version control!
